## About
A maze solver written in Java.
<br>
This project is in early stages. I have only implemented the A* algorithm for now. More search algorithms will follow. I will also try to implement some sort of time and space complexity measure and to compare various search algorithms.

## How to run
### Compile
- download the project
- compile the src folder
### Run
- from the src directory type <b>java MazeSolver ../mazes/<i>"maze-file-name"</i></b>

## All about mazes
I have included a couple of maze examples in the mazes folder, however, feel free to add your own mazes.<br>
